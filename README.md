# React App

Created for CS 30 as a final project, this application is based off help desk system for users to create support inquires and allows administrators to view all collected data. This project was built in both PHP and typescript (React Framework), with the ease of accessing data from a MySQL server. Even though the database is running on an unsecured server (HTTP), it is allowable as this is not intended to be a commercial project.
